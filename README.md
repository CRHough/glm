JGLM is the java port of the [OpenGL Mathematics (GLM)](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html) a mathematics library for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) specifications.

JGLM provides classes and functions designed and implemented with the same naming conventions (within reasonable terms) and functionalities than GLSL so that anyone, who knows GLSL or GLM, can use JGLM as well in java.

This project isn't limited to GLSL features. An extension system, based on the GLSL extension conventions, provides extended capabilities: matrix transformations, quaternions, data packing, random numbers, noise, etc...
